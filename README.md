# Wizzy-Game
Basic shooter game made with Java demonstrating OOP principals

As of 10/15/2019 Game works well and was turned in last semester as a project. Along with the main directory, there is also a jar file to execute the application. However, we could not get it to show the splashscreen.java file whenever we executed through the jar file.
